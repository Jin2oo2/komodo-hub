                At Komodo Hub, we believe in the power of technology to bring people, schools, and communities together in the mission to protect and preserve Indonesia's endangered species. Our journey began with a vision to create a digital platform that empowers individuals, schools, and communities to actively participate in conservation programs, share their knowledge, and make a positive impact on our precious wildlife.
